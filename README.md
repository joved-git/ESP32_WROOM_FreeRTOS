Here, you will find all the FreeeRTOS developments for my ESP32 WROOM.
See into the docs directory to find schemas, pinout and photos.
Look at the ./docs/Fiche-ESP32-WROOM-AZ.pdf file to find how to install the Arduino environment.

This examples are evolutions of examples given into the Warren Gay's book nammed "FreeRTOS for ESP32-Arduino" (version 2020).

Have fun ^^ !
